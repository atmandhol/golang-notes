Golang Tour Offline:
  - go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour

Basics:
  - Program start running in package main
  - fmt - package for input/output functions and print
  - math/rand - well, for random number stuff
  - Exported names are used to make functions and objects accessible 
  outside of the package.
  - Exported names start with capital letters.
  - So math.Pi, where math is the package and Pi is exported.

Packages:
  - The pypi for golang is here https://pkg.go.dev/

Constructs:
  - defer statements defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
  - defers are stacked and the last one is executed first
  - & operator generates a pointer to a variable
  - * denotes the underlying value
